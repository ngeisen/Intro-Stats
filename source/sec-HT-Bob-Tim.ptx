<exploration>
  <title>Facial Prototyping</title>
      <p>A study in <em>Psychonomic Bulletin and Review </em> (Lea, Thomas, Lamkin, and Bell, 2007) presented evidence that <q>people use facial prototypes when 
        they encounter different names.</q> Participants were given two faces and asked to identify which one was Tim and which one was Bob. The researchers 
        wrote that their participants “overwhelmingly agreed” on which face belonged to Tim and which face belonged to Bob but did not provide the exact 
        results of their study.

      <exercise>
        <title> Type of HT -Manually-authored exercise </title>
        <statement>
          <p>What statistical hypotheses and what type of test (left, right, or two-tail) should we use to determine whether UNC students, in general, use facial prototypes when they encounter different names. 
        <em>Let the parameter of interest be the probability that a student would assign the name Tim to the face on the left. </em></p>
