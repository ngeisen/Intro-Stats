        <p> How to graph students eye color with StatKey. </p>
        <p> Open a web browswer and copy <url href="http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/" /> </p>
        <p> Download the csv file <c> Lab 1 Data.csv </c> posted in Canvas and save to your computer where it is easily accessible. We are going to analyze the students eye colors. </p>
        <p> Under the <em> Descriptive Statistics and Graph </em> column on the left, choose the <em> One Categorical Variable </em>. </p>
        
        <figure xml:id="OneCatStatKey">

                <shortdescription>The second option under descriptive statitics menu is the one categorical variable.</shortdescription>

        <p> Click on the <c> Upload File  </c> button and locate the data file on your computer. </p> 
        <p>  Identify which variable you will analyze (Eye Color) and click OK. The program constructs a bar graph and frequency table. A sample output image is below. </p>

<p> <term>Interpreting Bar Graphs</term> </p>
<p> From the bar graph we can see that most students have brown eyes and green eyes occur the least. </p>
<p> From the frequency table we see the sample consisted of 63 UNC students. There are 34 students with brown eyes which is 54% of the class. </p>
    

<p> Using the graph above, which of the following statements are correct? Selelct all that apply. </p>

            This is represented by the tallest bar.

        <p>
            The distribution is right skewed.
        </p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
