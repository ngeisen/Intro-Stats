  "body": " The Statistical Investigation Process  Put before or after vocab is introduced? If after, then it can be used here...    The first part below is partially copied and pasted from an Airforce OER- need to credit or rewrite more.   Researchers and scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations. The collected observations form the backbone of statistical investigations and are called data. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. The Statistical Investigation Process can be divided into four main components:    Data Collection    Data Exploration    Data Analysis    Draw Conclusions from the Data.    Not all investigations will require all four steps. Some investigations are more exploratory in nature, for example. In this case, data may be collected without a research question in mind, and the goal is just to find interesting features in the data.  We will focus on traditional Statistical Investigations that span all four parts, and we will study methods used in each stage and how these methods affect amd depend on each other. Here are the four components again, but with more information on what each involves ( will expand this ):    Data Collection   Designing a study that allows for collection of relevant and accurate data.    Selecting who or what data will be colected from.       Data Exploration\/Descriptive Statistics    Computing summary statistics.    Summarizing data with graphs.      Data Analysis\/Statistical Inference    Confidence Intervals.    Hypothesis Tests      Draw Conclusions from the Data.    Association versus causation    Generalizing results beyond the study's subjects.      The topics that researchers and scientists investigate are as diverse as the questions they ask! However, many of these investigations can be addressed with just the basics that you will learn in this class.   Sleep or Caffeine for Memory?  The consumption of caffeine to benefit alertness is a common activity practiced by 90% of adults in North America. People often use caffeine to replace the need for sleep. We will look at a study that compared the effects of caffeine versus a daytime nap on the ability to recall memorized information. Click here to access the article containing the full investigation.   Research Question: Which is better for memory recall - caffeine or napping?  The research question, which is paraphrased above, can be found in the Introduction section of the article. Here, the researchers discuss why their work is important and relevant. They cite previous research on the topic, and explain how and why they arrived on their specific research question.   Step1: Data Collection: In the methods section of the article, the researchers describe the subjects that participated in their study, how the participating subjects were selected, exactly what the subjects had to do as participants, and what information (data) was collected.  For the portion of study that looked at memory recall of verbal information [The part of the study we are focusing on]:    The subjects were 33 adults, between the ages of 18 and 39, that were recruited and gave informed consent to participate.    Subjects were in the lab under supervision during the entire experimental day. At 09:30am, the verabl recall task began.    The experimenter read 24 unrelated words out loud, and subjects were immediately asked to recall as many of the words as possible. No feedback on performance was given. This was repeated three times.      Lunch was served at noon. Then at 1:00pm, subjects were randomly assigned to a take a nap, a caffiene pill, or placebo pill. So, subjects either took a nap (90-min of sleep maximum or up to 2 h in bed) starting at 1:00pm or were given an unmarked pill (200 mg caffeine or placebo) at 3:00pm. The experiementer recorded which group the subject was randomly assigned to.    Sixty minutes later (4:00pm), subjects' recall was officially tested. The experiement recorded the number of words correctly recalled.      Step 2: Data Exploration: In the Methods section of the article, the researchers summarized demographic information about the subjects, e.g. computing average age of subjects randomly assigned to each group, as well as the number of male and females in each group.   Put in data from article       1111  2222    aaaa  bbbb    AAAA  BBBB     The Results section of the article graphically compares the average number of words recalled across groups using a bar chart. explain error bars    Need to recreate this graph [currently stolen]. Shows that the Nap group recalled more words, on average, compared to the other two groups.   Bar chart comparing means, with error bars  bar chart.    What do you think is the purpose of including the placebo group?    Step 3: Data Analysis: In the Analysis section of the article, the researchers describe which statistical inference methods were used to analyze the data, and the results of the data analyses are provided in the Results section of the article. \"To examine that, we utilized a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using three levels of the variable Group (caffeine, nap, placebo), separately for recall and recognition. Significant ANOVAs were followed-up by examining differences between groups at the specific time point with independent samples t-tests.\" \"Recall memory for Word List 1 after 7 h retention interval showed significant group differences (F = 5.41 p = 0.009, partial eta2 = 0.25, Fig. 2a). Post hoc tests showed: (a) the nap group performed significantly better than the caffeine group (p = 0.003); (b) nap performed marginally better than placebo (p = 0.06.); and (c) there were non-significant differences between caffeine and placebo (p = 0.22). Recognition memory for words after a 7 h retention interval also showed significant group differences for d’ (F = 4.51 p = 0.019, partial eta2 = 0.22, Fig. 2b). Post hoc tests showed: (a) nap performed significantly better than caffeine (p = 0.008); (b) nap better than placebo (p = 0.03); and (c) no difference between caffeine and placebo (p = 0.50).\"   Step 4: Draw Conclusions from the Data: In the Discussion section of the article, the researchers state their overall conclusions obtained during Steps 2 and 3. Conclusions are written in the context of the entire investigation and in relationship to findings from previous studies. Conclusions are applied more boradly (beyond the subjects in the study), and researchers conclude that napping directly causes the higher recall ability. They state ...naps improved the ability to learn a new list of words ... .   Studies must be designed in a specific way in order to draw cause-and-effect conclusions!

  "title": "Working with Data",
  "body": " Working with Data    At the end of this section you will able to     Understand and apply the vocabulary associated with statistics.    Distinguish between quantitative data and categorical data.     You may ask yourself, what is statistics? Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect, organize, analyze and interpret data.  We are going to use an investigative approach to learning about statistics. We will look at different ways of collecting data (such as with surveys and questionnaires). We will organize the data with graphs and tables so we can see what the data tells us at a glance. We will describe the data with numerical summaries (known as statistics) and word descriptions. Later in the semester we will look at other ways to analyze data, such as finding intervals to predict a typical value and compare whether the sample is similar or different from previously known values.  The subjects\/objects that we obtain information about are called the cases or units in a dataset. These are represented as the rows  A variable is any characteristic that is recorded for each case. The variables generally correspond to the columns in a data table.  A categorical variable divides the cases into groups, placing each case into exactly one of two or more categories.  A quantitative variable measures or records a numerical quantity for each case.   Data are the values or measurements the variables assume.  For example, what are the majors for the students in your class? The major is the variable since there are multiple responses from the students (such as math major, history major, education, nursing, biology major). Other variables you can ask students in your class are their grade level (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and the number of credit hours taken this semester. If we asked the students (case) in class, there will be lots of different majors (data).  There are two key terms we use to distinguish the groups we collect data from:   The population is the set of all subjects in the study.    A sample is a group or subset of subjects selected from the population.   If we asked ALL residents of the state of Colorado where they were born, then the Colorado residents would be the population. But if we asked just some people from a single city in the state of Colorado, they would a sample from the state.  There are two main branches of statistics that we are interested in.  In descriptive statistics the statistician tries to describe a situation. It consists of collecting, organizing, summarizing and presenting the data.  While with inferential statistics the statisticians make inferences from samples to make predictions about the population. It consists of generalizing data from samples, performing estimations and hypothesis testing, determining relationships among variables, and making predictions.    Student Survey  Students in past semesters completed a survey in introductory statistics courses. The entire Student Survey Dataset is a comma-separated values document that includes responses from 362 students on the following 17 variables.    Year: Year in school  Sex: F=female or M=male  Smoke: Smoker? No or Yes  Award: Preferred award, Academy, Nobel, or Olympic  HigherSAT: Which SAT is higher? Math or Verbal  Exercise: Hours of exercise per week  TV: Hours of TV viewing per week  Height: Height (in inches)  Weight: Weight (in pounds)  Siblings: Number of siblings  BirthOrder: Birth order, 1=oldest  VerbalSAT: Verbal SAT score  MathSAT: Math SAT scorer  SAT: Combined Verbal + Math SAT  GPA: College grade point average  Pulse: Pulse rate (beats per minute)  Piercings: Number of body piercings      Here is the first 15 entries of the dataset:   15 Student Responses   The first 15 entries of the Student Survey Dataset    Answer the following questions about the first 15 entries of the dataset.   Rows of Data   What does each row represent?      Each row is a list of responses by a student.    Correct. Each row is a student response.      Each row is a list of responses of a case.    Well done. a \"case\" is a survey-taker and is an important vocabulary word to know.      Each row is the list of responses of students on a single item of the survey.    Rethink your selection. Responses on a single item are listed vertically.      Each row is a variable.    The entries of a row do vary, but they do not represent different responses on a single survey item.         Columns of Data   What does each column represent?      Each column is the list of responses of students on a single item of the survey.    Correct. Columns are the item responses.      Each column is a variable.    Well done. A \"variable\" is the responses of a survey item and is an important vocabulary word to know.      Each column is a list of responses by a student.

  "body": " Collecting Data  Text of section.  Recall that the population is the set of all subjects for the study, while a sample is a group or subset selected from the population. It is often difficult or too expensive to examine the whole population for a study, thus we use a sample to help us draw conclusions about the population. When we choose a sample, we want it to be as similar to the population as possible. We are going to simulate several sampling methods using Gettysburg’s Address as the population.  President Abraham Lincoln delivered one of the most famous speeches in United States history at the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery on November 19, 1863. After the featured speaker spoke for two hours, Lincoln delivered his 269-word message in approximately two minutes. Our goal is to estimate the average length of words in Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address by selecting a sample of ten words. The entire text of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address is given below.   Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.   Step 1: Your task is to select a sample of 10 words to estimate the average length of words in his speech. Pick words that appear to be representative of the population of all the words. If you print the address, you can circle the ten words you choose.  Step 2: Find the lengths (number of letters) for each of the 10 words you selected.  Step 3: Calculate the average number of letters for the 10 words in your sample. Take the total number of letters and divide by the 10 words for the average. Exercise: Which best describes your average value for the average word length?  Your average word length   Which best describes your average value for the average word length?      Between 3 and 6 letters per word.    That is a good estimate.      Less than 3 letters per word.    This estimate is a bit low, there are a lot of large words not included in your sample.      More than 6 letters per word.    This estimate is a bit high, you likely included a lot of the larger words and did not include some of the smaller words      The image below is a class distribution of the average number of letters for the Gettysburg Address by circling ten words. Each dot represents the average value for a student. There were 64 student samples taken. We can see the values range from 3.4 to 6.4 with the center around 5.5 letters per word, thus this will be our predicted value for the typical word length. But it turns out, we are often biased in the words we select. Some students selected bigger words to be representative, others selected more smaller words. Did you notice how many two and three letter words there were? Were you biased in your sampling selection??   Image of Average Word Length from Gettysburg Address   Shows average word length prediction for 64 students clustered between 5 and 6.     Sampling bias occurs when the method of selecting a sample causes the sample to differ from the population in some relevant way. If sampling bias exists, we cannot trust generalizations from the sample to the population. So, we need a better method for predicting the typical or average value.  Now let's investigate using a more random approach in selecting the words for a better estimate of the population average.  Randomly choose ten numbers between 1 and 269 and record them. Find the corresponding word in Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address and find the average word length for your new sample.  You can also use technology to find the random numbers. Try the link for a random number generator at Go midway down the page to Numbers and select Integer Generator . Generate 10 random integers between 1 and 269. Click on Get Numbers . Sample below  Image RandomOrg menu   image of website menu.    The image below is a sample of ten randomly selected numbers using the applet.   Image Sample of random numbers   lists ten random numbers.    Matching these numbers to the corresponding word in Gettysburg Address gives the average of 3.9 letters per word. This is closer to the actual average of 4.3 letters per word. We will look at the class distribution later.   Sample of Gettysburg Address words   Image of highlighted words.    "

Correctly identify the explanatory and response variables.     Recall there are two main types of studies:   observational studies where researchers collect data by watching or asking questions, and draw conclusions based on these observations.   Experimental Studies where the researcher manipulates a variable to determine how the treatment influences the other variables.    Identify the type of study described: A researcher decided to check the Greeley Police Department records for 2 months to determine what types of crimes were committed.      Observational study    Observational study because they are looking at the records, not manipulating a variable.      Experimental study    They are not manipulating a variable.       Identify the type of study described. •  Identify the type of study described: A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups: consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks or consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels.      Experimental study    They are manipulating a variable.      Observational study    Experimental since they are manipulating a variable.      Many observational studies involve surveys and questionnaires, which uses questions to collect the data for the study. Others look at historical records to collect the data. In educational environment, observations of the participants is how the data is collected – by jotting down notes or videotaping the behaviors.  There are three main types of variables we will look at within an experimental study.  The independent variable is the variable that is being manipulated by the researchers. It is also called the explanatory variable.  The dependent variable is the result of manipulation. It is also called the response variable.  A confounding variable is one that influences the dependent variable but cannot be separated from the independent variable.  For this example, identify the variables. A sample of 50 men with high triglyceride levels were randomly assigned to two groups: one consumed 2 tablespoons of oat bran daily for 6 weeks and the other group consumed 2 tablespoons of wheat bran for 6 weeks, to determine which bran worked better to lower their triglyceride levels.  Type of bran consumed is the independent variable. They want to determine which one works better in lowering the triglyceride levels.  Whether or not the triglyceride level changes is the dependent variable. This is the result of the of manipulating which type of bran they consumed.  In this case, both bran groups were in the treatment group, there was not control group in the study.  There are several possible confounding variables in this study. Things that could influence the triglyceride levels could be diet, amount of exercise, current healthy, and weight of the participants.   Identify the type of variable. •  What variable is the type of bran the participants consumed?      independent variable    Yes, because they want to see if the type of bran influences the triglyceride level.      dependent variable    No, the dependent variable is the triglyceride level.      confounding variable    There were no confounding variable listed, but a person’s diet and health may influence the results.

  "body": " Types of Data    At the end of this section you will able to:    You may ask yourself, what is statistics? Statistics is the science of conducting studies to collect, organize, analyze and interpret data.  We are going to use an investigative approach to learning about statistics. We will look at different ways of collecting data (such as with surveys and questionnaires). We will organize the data with graphs and tables so we can see what the data tells us at a glance. We will describe the data with numerical summaries (known as statistics) and word descriptions. Later in the semester we will look at other ways to analyze data, such as finding intervals to predict a typical value and compare whether the sample is similar or different from previously known values. We will also investigate if there is an association between varibles.  To begin this journey, let’s look at some vocabulary commonly associated with statistics.   A case is the unit of observation, typically a person or object that you are interested in finding information about.    A variable is a characteristic that can assume different values, the measurement or observation about the case (unit).     Data are the values or measurements the variables assume.    For example , what are the majors for the students in your class? The major is the variable since there are multiple responses from the students (such as math major, history major, education, nursing, biology major). Other variables you can ask students in your class are their grade level (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and the number of credit hours taken this semester. If we asked the students (case) in class, there will be lots of different majors (data).  There are two key terms we use to distinguish the groups we collect data from:   The population is the set of all subjects in the study.    A sample is a group or subset of subjects selected from the population.   If we asked ALL residents of the state of Colorado where they were born, then the Colorado residents would be the population. But if we asked just some people from a single city in the state of Colorado, they would a sample from the state.  There are two main branches of statistics that we are interested in.  In descriptive statistics the statistician tries to describe a situation. It consists of collecting, organizing, summarizing and presenting the data.  While with inferential statistics the statisticians make inferences from samples to make predictions about the population. It consists of generalizing data from samples, performing estimations and hypothesis testing, determining relationships among variables, and making predictions.  Identify if each situation is descriptive or inferential statistics:  There are two main types of data we will be working with:   Qualitative variables are placed into distinct categories. Such as the color of cars found in a parking lot. The car colors can be classified as white, red, blue, and black.   Quantitative variables are numerical and can be ordered. There are two types of quantitative variables. Discrete variables can be counted, such as the number of cars in the different parking lots. The values are whole numbers. Other numerical variables are continuous variables , meaning any value (decimal or fraction) can occur. These are often obtained by measuring something. A continuous variable could be the length of the cars in the parking lot or the time it takes a car to stop when traveling 20 miles per hour.  "

One categorical variable    Two categorical variables    One quantitative variable    Two quantitative variables    One quantitative variable and one categorical variable    Once a researcher has gathered the data for a particular variable, they need a way to summarize the data in a meaningful way.

Once a researcher has gathered the data for a particular variable, they need a way to summarize the data in a meaningful way. Generally, the first step is organizing the data and then presenting the data in graphs and charts. A convenient method is organizing the data in a frequency distribution. With categorical data, the frequency represents the number of times a particular category occurs from the raw data. This is organized in a frequency table summarizing each category with its frequency. This works best with nominal and ordinal level data.  On the first day of class, students respond to the Class Survey by identifying their eye color. In the sample of 20 students below, construct a frequency table to summarize the data.   Image of Raw Eye Color Data   Lists 20 eye colors.    The data is organized into 4 distinct categories. With this smaller data set we can count how many have brown eyes, how many have blue eyes, then green and hazel. With a larger data set we will use technology to help us find the frequency. From this sample there are 10 with brown eyes, 4 have blue eyes, 4 have green eyes, and 2 have hazel eyes. If we add the counts together, we get our sample of 20 students.   Image of Eye Frequency   Frequency of 10 brown, 4blue, 4 green, and 2 hazel.    Once we have the tallies, we can graph the data as a bar graph or bar chart. We typically list the categories along the horizontal x-axis and the frequencies vertically along the y-axis, as shown below. The height of each bar represents the frequency for that category.   Image of Eye Bar Graph   Bar graph showing of 10 brown, 4blue, 4 green, and 2 hazel.    The bar graph allows us to quickly see that brown occurs most often and hazel eyes occurred least often in this sample.  A relative frequency table also shows the proportion or percentage of cases that fall in each category, as shown below.   Image of Eye Relative Frequency Table   Relative frequency table showing of 50% brown, 20% blue, 20% green, and 10% hazel.    The proportion of some category is found by     Brown eyes occurred 10 times out of the sample of 20 students thus which is 50% of the students. Blue eyes occurred 4 times out of the sample of 20 students thus which is 20% of the students.  The proportion for a sample is denoted and read “p-hat.”  The proportion for a population is denoted .  Categorical data can also be graphed as pie graph or circle chart. The graph typically includes the percentage for each of the categories.   Image of Eye Circle Graph   Graph showing of 50% brown, 20% blue, 20% green, and 10% hazel.    See the section for Graphing with StatKey for details on how to graph using technology.  "

Calculate the mean, median, and mode from a data set.    Calculate the mean and median using technology.     This section focuses on measures of central tendency. Many times you are asking what to expect \"on average\" or what is a typical value. These types of questions can be answered by knowing the center of the data set. There are three measures of the center of the data. They are the mean, median, and mode.  The mode is the data value that occurs the most frequently in the data. To find it, you count how often each data value occurs, and then determine which data value occurs most often. This is easily seen with a dot plot.  The median is the value in the middle of a sorted list of data. To find it, you put the data in order from smallest to larger, and then determine which data value is in the middle of the data set. If there is an odd number of values, it will land on an actually data value. When there is an even number of values you will need to average the middle two values.  The mean is the arithmetic average of the numbers. You will add all the values together then divide by the number of values.   Sample: A sample of five students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 72, 36, 36, 25, 48.   Solution: The mode is 36 since it occurs most often. Since there are five values, the middle value is 25, 36, 36 , 48, 72 when arranged in order, thus the median is 36. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 5, thus 217\/5 = 43.4 apps per person. This is higher than the median because it is skewed to the right by the large value of 72.  A data set can have more than one mode. If there is a tie between two values for the most number of times, then both values are the mode and the data is called bimodal (two modes). If every data point occurs the just once, there is no mode. If there are multiple modes, then it is referred to being multimodal .   Sample: A sample of six students have the following number of apps on their cellular phones: 25, 36, 36, 48, 72, 72.   Solution: This is bimodal with modes of 36 and 72 since both occur twice. Since there are six values, the middle value is (36+48)\/2=42, thus the median is 42 apps. The mean is the sum of the values divided by 6, thus 289\/6 = 48.167 apps per person.   Find the measures of center  Find the mode, median, and mean for the data set 4, 5, 6?  find the sum of the values and divide by the number of values.  No mode, median = 5, mean = 5    .    "

Calculate the variance and standard deviation.     Variability is an important idea in statistics. If we were to measure the height of everyone in our class, every observation could give a different value. That means not every student is the same height. Thus, there is variability in the heights of the students in class. If we asked the heights of students in several different classes, there will be variation among the different samples. Variability describes how the data are spread out. If the data are very close to each other, then there is low variability. If the data are very spread out, then there is high variability. We will investigate the range, variance, and standard deviation as measures of spread in the values.  The range of a set of data is the difference between the largest and the smallest data values (also known as the maximum and minimum values). This lets us know how spread apart the extreme values of the data are.  A better way is to describe the variability is with the standard deviation, which is the average distance each value is from the mean. We will illustrate this with an example and then review how to calculate it using technology.  The sample standard deviation is designated by and the variance is . The formula is     The formula says we took each value X and subtracted the mean, we squared the difference, then add them all together, then divided by one less than the sample size to get the variance.

The interquartile range (IQR) , is the difference between the first and third quartiles, thus which represents the middle 50% of the data.

  "body": " Probability Basics    At the end of this section you will able to:    Find the probabilty of a single event.    Determine if outcomes are equally likely.      In this chapter we will learn a little about probability. Many people are familiar with probability from playing games of chance, such as flipping coins, rolling dice and playing cards. We will use several of these examples to help explain the rules of probability.  The questions that probability can help with are your chances that the car you are buying will need more maintenance, your chances of passing a class, your chances of winning the lottery, your chances of being in a car accident. The chance of winning the lottery is very small, yet many people will spend the money on lottery tickets. Yet, if instead they saved the money that they spend on the lottery, they would have more money. In general, events that have a low probability (under 5%) are unlikely to occur. Whereas if an event has a high probability of happening (over 80%), then there is a good chance that the event will happen.  First let us review some definitions to help us understand probability.   Experiment is an activity that has specific results that can occur, but the result is unknown before you begin. Such as flipping a coin.  The outcomes are the results of an experiment. The outcomes from flipping a coin is head or tail.  An event is a set of certain outcomes of an experiment that you want to have happen. So if I want to know the likelihood of getting heads, getting heads is the event I want to happen.  The sample space is the collection of all possible outcomes of the experiment. For a single coin toss the sample space is the same as heads or tails. But if I toss two coins, say a penny and nickel, then the sample space includes all possible outcomes: head on penny and head on nickel, head on penny but tail on nickel, tail on penny with head on nickel, or tails on both penny and nickel. Now there are four outcomes in the sample space.  exercise  To determine the likelihood of flipping heads, we need to perform the experiment. Suppose you toss a coin 10 times and heads landed up 4 times. Based on this experiment, the probability of getting heads is 4 out of 10 tries or 4\/10 = 2\/5 =.40 or 40%. Probabilities can be written as decimals, fractions, or percentages. Suppose you toss the coin 1000 times and heads occurred 513 times. Thus the probability of heads is now 513\/100 = 51.3% of the time. This is an example of experimental probability since the value was found by actually doing the experiment.  The approximate probability of an event A, written as , is  Most likely you know that the probability of flipping a heads is ½ since there are two sides to the coin. This illustrates theoretical probability which is based on the sample space. But it assumes that all outcomes are equally likely to occur.  "

Urban-Suburban Temperature Investigation  The phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect suggests that urban areas retain more heat than their surrounding suburban or rural areas. A climatologist wondered if the UHI effect is a statistically measurable phenomenon or simply an urban myth. The following tasks analyze climatological data from the summer 2024.  Available Data   NOAA Regional Climate Centers ( https:\/\/scacis.rcc-acis.org\/ ) provides climatological data from stations across the United States. The following information is available from many of the stations:  Temperature    Date: The specific day of the observation.    MaxTemperature: The highest air temperature recorded during a 24-hour period.    MinTemperature: The lowest air temperature recorded during a 24-hour period.    AvgTemperature: The average of the maximum and minimum temperatures for a day.    AvgTemperatureDeparture: The difference between the observed average temperature and a long-term average (typically a 30-year period), indicating how much warmer or cooler the day was compared to the norm.    Degree Day    HDD (Heating Degree Days): A measure of how much (in degrees) and for how long (in days) the outside air temperature was below a certain base temperature (commonly 65°F). It's used to estimate the energy needed for heating.    CDD (Cooling Degree Days): A measure of how much (in degrees) and for how long (in days) the outside air temperature was above a certain base temperature (commonly 65°F). It's used to estimate the energy needed for cooling.    Precipitation and Snow    Precipitation: The total amount of water (in liquid equivalent) that has fallen, including rain, snow, sleet, and hail.    Snowfall: The total amount of snow that has fallen, typically measured in inches.    SnowDepth: The depth of the snow on the ground at a specific time, measured in inches.     Data Organization  The climatologist collected the data at the Denver Water Department near downtown Denver, Colorado. The complete dataset is available ( MetroDenver_Climatological-Data.csv ).   Urban Heat Data   Image of datafile showing 15 cities.     Interpretation Questions From Data Table    Rows  Describe what each row represents and describe it in context.  Each row is called a case. It is the information from the climate station for the specific day (the first through the fifteenth) in August 2024.    Columns  Describe what each column represents.  Each column represents a variable. Each column is a measurement of temperature, degree days, and precipitation at the climate station.    Variable  For the column labeled “Den_MaxTemperature”, describe the data values in context, the type of data collected, and determine all the possible data values.  It is the highest air temperature recorded during a 24-hour period in Denver, CO. The variable is quantitative since numerical data. The continuous temperatures appear to be rounded to the nearest integer between 67 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.    Commonalities  Determine one thing in common for the dates when the high temperature in Denver was 100°F.  Minimum temperatures in the 60s, average temperatures in the 80s, highest average temperature departures, zero HDD, highest CDD values, and zero snow-related values.     Differences  Determine one thing that was different for the dates when the high temperature in Denver was 100°F.  One day had measurable precipitation while the other did not.     Data Display  How would a climatologist characterize the high temperatures of Denver, Colorado, in summer 2024?  The following histogram presents that high temperatures from June 1 to August 31, 2024, at the Denver Water Department near downtown Denver.   Denver High Temperatures   Shows daily high temperature with most values between 85 and 100 with a few lower temps down to 65F.     Shape  Describe the shape of the dataset in context.   The high temperatures of Denver in summer 2024 were skewed left.    Center  StatKey reports the mean as 90.78. Interpret it in context.  Typical high temperature at the Denver station was 90.78°F in summer 2024.    Spread  StatKey reports the standard deviation as 6.47. Interpret it in context.   The standard deviation is a measure of spread. According to the 95% rule, we would expect approximately 95% of the temperatures in Denver in summer 2024 to be within 2 standard deviations (2*6.47 = 12.94) of the mean. Because the dataset is skewed left, the 95% rule might not apply as well as it does when the dataset is bell-shaped.      Association Between Variables  The climatologist collected the data at two stations in the Denver Metro Area in Colorado from June 1 to August 31, 2024. The urban station was the Denver Water Department near downtown Denver. The suburban station was located at the Denver Centennial Airport in Centennial, Colorado. The complete dataset is available (MetroDenver_Temperatures.csv).  One preliminary way to determine if UHI effect exists is to decide if there is a visual association between location (urban or suburban) and high temperature.  The graph below shows the boxplot of high temperatures at the two Metro Denver climate stations.   Comparing Heat Boxplot   comparing heat temperatures between Denver and Centennial.     Outliers  Identify any outliers in the dataset. State each outlier value and its corresponding station location.   There was one outlier temperature for each climate station represented by the asterisk. Denver had a lower outlier temperature of 67F. Centennial had a lower outlier temperature of 64F.     Medians  Estimate the median temperature values of the two datasets and compare them in context.   In summer 2024, the median high temperature for Denver was 91.5 F while the median high temperature for Centennial was 88 F, suggesting that the typical urban high temperature was 6.5 F higher than the typical suburban high temperature at the two locations.     IQR  Estimate the interquartile ranges (IQRs) of the two datasets and compare them in context.   In summer 2024, the IQR for Denver was 96-87 = 9 F and for Centennial was 93 – 85 = 8 F, suggesting that the spread of the middle 50% of the values of the temperatures was similar for both locations.     Association  Based on the boxplot, is there an association between the high temperatures between Denver and Centennial? Explain your thinking.   An association exists between a categorical variable (location) and a numerical variable (high temperature), if the difference between the measures of center in relation to the measure of spread distinguishes the two datasets.  The difference between the two medians was 6.5 F. The IQRs of the high temperatures of the two locations was about 8.5 F. The proportion of the difference of center to spread was 0.76. There is some visual evidence to suggest that high temperature is associated with location since the box for Denver is shifted farther to the right. Later we will determine this numerically with hypothesis testing.      Study Type  The phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect suggests that urban areas retain more heat than their surrounding suburban or rural areas. A climatologist wondered if the UHI effect is a statistically measurable phenomenon or simply an urban myth.   Study 1  A climatologist collected the data at two stations in the Denver Metro Area in Colorado from June 1 to August 31, 2024. The urban station was the Denver Water Department near downtown Denver. The suburban station was located at the Denver Centennial Airport in Centennial, Colorado.  Answer the following questions regarding Study 1.   Sample  Identify the sample. Is the sample representative of the population? Briefly explain.   The sample is the temperatures at the two climate stations in the Denver metro area during the summer 2024. The sample is representative of recent summer high temperatures in the Denver metro area.     Variables  Identify the variables and classify as explanatory or response. Describe what type of variable each is.   The explanatory variable is the location (urban versus nearby suburban), thus categorical or qualitative. The response variable is high temperature (measured in degrees Fahrenheit), thus numeric or quantitative.     Study Design  What research design did the climatologist use to answer the research question? Briefly explain.   The study is a matched pair design. The climatologist obtained the data at two climate stations in the same metro area on the same days in summer 2024.  This is an observational study. The climatologist did not actively induce change in the explanatory variable, but rather the climatologist recorded the high temperatures at the two different climate stations in the Denver metro area on the same days in summer 2024.     Causation  If the researcher finds an association between the explanatory and response variables, would it also be appropriate to conclude causation? Explain.   Because the study is an observational study, any association may not be concluded as causation. There may be confounding variables unaccounted for in the study that affect the high temperatures of the urban and suburban stations other than the UHI effect. For example, Denver is near the Rocky Mountain range; geographical phenomena may influence the temperatures at the stations rather than the UHI effect.     Study 2   A climatologist obtained a list of 20 most urban areas\/cities in the United States. Using the map of climate stations from the NOAA Regional Climate Centers (https:\/\/scacis.rcc-acis.org\/), the climatologist selected an urban station near the center of the city. Next, the climatologist zoomed out from the selected urban station to find a nearby suburban station. In most cases, the climatologist selected the nearest station that recorded the same climatological data located just outside the city’s loop or beltway (i.e., the large, controlled-access highway that encircles a city). The following is a table of the metro areas and the climate stations selected by the climatologist.  Table of cities   Sample  Identify the sample. Is the sample representative of the population? Briefly explain.   The sample is the temperatures at the two climate stations in 20 most populated metro areas in the US in August 2024. The sample is representative of recent summer high temperatures of urban and suburban locations in metro areas in the US.     Variables  Identify the variables and classify as explanatory or response. Describe what type of variable each is.   The explanatory variable is the location (urban versus nearby suburban) which is categorical. The response variable is high temperature (measured in degrees Fahrenheit) which is numerical.     Study Design  What research design did the climatologist use to answer the research question? Briefly explain.   The study is a matched pair design. The climatologist obtained data on the same day in August 2024 for climate stations of 20 metro areas. Thus, the data for each day is paired by location. This is an observational study. The climatologist did not actively induce change in the explanatory variable, but rather the climatologist recorded the high temperatures at the two different climate stations in 20 metro areas.     Causation  If the researcher finds an association between the explanatory and response variables, would it also be appropriate to conclude causation? Explain.   Because the study is an observational study, any association may not be concluded as causation. However, given the diverse locations of the 20 urban areas, a single confounding variable consistent among the metro areas is less likely than selecting the high temperatures at a single urban area.      Estimating with Bootstrapping  A climatologist collected the data at two stations in the Denver Metro Area in Colorado from June 1 to August 31, 2024. The urban station was the Denver Water Department near downtown Denver. The suburban station was located at the Denver Centennial Airport in Centennial, Colorado.  The climatologist wanted to infer the true difference in high temperatures during the summer between the two stations. So, he calculated the difference in high temperatures between the Denver station and the Centennial station each day. The original sample displays a dotplot of the temperature differences. The bootstrap sample displays one dotplot generated by StatKey.   Bootstrap Samples   original sample and a bootstrap sample.     Bootstrap Sample  Explain how StatKey obtained the Bootstrap Sample.   A bootstrap sample is randomly generated from the original sample with replacement with the same sample size as the original. That is, 92 values from the original sample were randomly selected with replacement to form the bootstrap sample. The bootstrap sample statistic is the mean of 4.5 as the average difference in temperature for the sample.    The dotplot below is a bootstrap distribution of the difference in high temperatures from StatKey based on the high temperature data recorded in summer 2024 (the original sample).   Bootstrap Distribution of 1000 samples   Bootstrap Distribution of 1000 samples.    Answer the following using the Bootstrap distribution.   Bootstrap Dotplot  Identify on the dotplot the relevant value obtained from the bootstrap sample. Briefly explain what you indicated.   There is a single dot for the value of 4.5 in the dotplot. It is the mean of the given bootstrap sample from above. Recall that each dot represents the mean from a bootstrap sample. The bootstrap distribution shows 1000 samples with each sample of 92 values of the difference in temperature.     Standard Error  State the standard error for the bootstrap distribution.   The dotplot states that the standard error is 0.631, which measures the spread in the distribution from the mean.     Margin of Error  Determine the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference of high temperatures.   The margin of error using the 95% Rule is 2 times the standard error, thus 2(0.631) = 1.262. The margin of error is how precise the value of 2.783 (the sample mean difference) is as an estimate for the typical mean difference of high temperatures between the Denver and Centennial climate stations.     Interval  Use the bootstrap distribution to compute a 95% confidence interval for the actual mean difference of high temperatures between the Denver and Centennial climate stations. Round values to three decimal places.   Using the 95% Rule,  Lower bound:  Upper bound:  The 95% confidence interval is (1.521, 4.045).  We are 95% confident that the true mean difference of high temperatures between the Denver and Centennial climate stations is between 1.521 F and 4.045 F.  We are 95% confident that the actual high temperature at the Denver climate stations is on average between 1.521 F and 4.045 F hotter than at the Centennial climate station during the summer months.      Using Randomization Samples  A climatologist collected the data at three stations in the Denver Metro Area in Colorado from June 1 to August 31, 2024. The following is a summary of the clinical stations:    Denver Water Department near downtown Denver (urban station)    Denver Centennial Airport in Centennial, southeast of downtown Denver (suburban station)    Lakewood, a suburb west of downtown Denver (suburban station)    The climatologist wanted to test whether there were any statistical differences in high temperatures of the three climate stations during summer months. So, he calculated the difference in high temperatures between each pair of stations: Denver–Centennial, Denver–Lakewood, and Centennial–Lakewood.   Study 1   In the first study, the climatologist wanted to decide using statistical analysis if the UHI effect was statistically credible. He examined the differences in high temperatures between two climate stations - one urban and one suburban in the Denver metro area - to test the claim that there is a statistical difference that we would expect if there were a UHI effect.  The original sample displays a dotplot of the differences between the high temperatures of the Denver and Centennial stations. The randomization sample displays one dotplot generated by StatKey.   Randomization Sample   original sample and a randomized sample.     Randomized Sample  Explain how StatKey obtained the Randomization Sample.   A randomization sample for paired data is obtained when we assume that there is no difference between the Denver and Centennial high temperatures, thus the population mean of the differences is zero. So, the center of the randomization dotplot should be centered at the null value of 0. The standard error of the randomization dotplot should be equal to the sampling distribution using the original sample and generating random samples of size 92.  StatKey generates the Randomization Sample by randomly selecting 92 values from the original sample with replacement, into two groups and finds the difference between each pair, so that the randomization sample is centered at 0.     Dotplot  Identify on the dotplot the relevant value obtained from the randomization sample. Briefly explain what you indicated.   The mean of the randomization sample is 1.5. The red dot displays the mean of the randomization sample on the distribution below. Each dot in the distribution below is the average difference between the two randomized groups    Below is a randomization distribution from StatKey based on the climatologist’s claim for 2000 samples.   Randomization Distribution   Randomized distribution of 2000 samples centered at zero.     Hypotheses  Write the null and alternative hypotheses for the climatologist's claim.   Let be the population mean of the difference in the paired high temperatures between the Denver and Centennial stations. Then, the hypotheses are: and      Sample statistic  d. What is the observed sample statistic of the original sample? Estimate where to plot this observed statistic on the randomization dotplot.   The mean of the sample data is . However, the value 2.783 is too far to the right of the maximum value on the randomization dotplot to be identified on the graph. Thus it is unlikely to occur by random chance     p-value  Estimate and interpret the p-value using the randomization distribution.   None of the 2000 random samples were greater than or equal to the sample statistic 2.783. So, the p-value = 0\/2000 = 0.  When we assume that there is no difference in the high temperatures between the Denver and Centennial stations, the chance of getting the mean difference of 2.783 is near zero, thus highly unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis true. This indicates that the difference is statistically significant.     Conclusion  Based on the climatologist's results, what decision and what conclusion would the climatologist make for their investigation assuming α=0.05? Explain your answer.   It is very unlikely that we would get a mean difference of 2.783 by chance if the actual difference was 0. It is much less than the confidence level α=0.05. So, we would reject the assumption that there is no difference between the high temperatures at the Denver and Centennial stations. There is evidence that there is a statistical difference between the high temperatures at the urban and suburban stations, and the average high temperature at the urban station was greater than the average high temperature at the suburban station.

A randomization sample for paired data is obtained when we assume that there is no difference between the Denver and Centennial high temperatures, thus the population mean of the differences is zero. So, the center of the randomization dotplot should be centered at the null value of 0. The standard error of the randomization dotplot should be equal to the sampling distribution using the original sample and generating random samples of size 92.  StatKey generates the Randomization Sample by randomly selecting 92 values from the original sample with replacement, into two groups and finds the difference between each pair, so that the randomization sample is centered at 0.

It is very unlikely that we would get a mean difference of 2.783 by chance if the actual difference was 0. It is much less than the confidence level α=0.05. So, we would reject the assumption that there is no difference between the high temperatures at the Denver and Centennial stations. There is evidence that there is a statistical difference between the high temperatures at the urban and suburban stations, and the average high temperature at the urban station was greater than the average high temperature at the suburban station.
