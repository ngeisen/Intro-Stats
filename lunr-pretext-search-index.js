Distinguish between quantitative data and categorical data.      Statistsics is the science of collecting, describing, and analyzing data.  The subjects\/objects that we obtain information about are called the cases or units in a dataset. These are represented as the rows  A variable is any characteristic that is recorded for each case. The variables generally correspond to the columns in a data table.  A categorical variable divides the cases into groups, placing each case into exactly one of two or more categories.  A quantitative variable measures or records a numerical quantity for each case.

Open a web browswer and copy   Download the csv file Lab 1 Data.csv posted in Canvas and save to your computer where it is easily accessible. We are going to analyze the students eye colors.  Under the Descriptive Statistics and Graph column on the left, choose the One Categorical Variable .   Image of StatKey menu   The second option under descriptive statitics menu is the one categorical variable.    Click on the Upload File button and locate the data file on your computer.  Identify which variable you will analyze (Eye Color) and click OK. The program constructs a bar graph and frequency table. A sample output image is below.   Sample image of StatKey output.   Sample image of bar graph and frequency table of the students eye color.     Interpreting Bar Graphs   From the bar graph we can see that most students have brown eyes and green eyes occur the least.  From the frequency table we see the sample consisted of 63 UNC students. There are 34 students with brown eyes which is 54% of the class.  Using the graph above, which of the following statements are correct? Selelct all that apply.  Interpreting information from a graph  Using the graph above, select all statements that apply.     Brown eyes occur most often for these students.    This is represented by the tallest bar.      Blue eyes occurred 22.2%    Take the frequency count and divide by the sample size for the percentage.      The sample size is 54 students.    Look at the total from the frequency table.      The distribution is right skewed.    We do not discuss distribution shape with categorical data.     "

Facial Prototyping  A study in Psychonomic Bulletin and Review (Lea, Thomas, Lamkin, and Bell, 2007) presented evidence that people use facial prototypes when they encounter different names. Participants were given two faces and asked to identify which one was Tim and which one was Bob. The researchers wrote that their participants “overwhelmingly agreed” on which face belonged to Tim and which face belonged to Bob but did not provide the exact results of their study.  Use StatKey to answer the first two checkpoint questions below. Click here to access the actual article.     HT -Manually-authored exercise  Perform a full hypothesis test to determine whether UNC students, in general, use facial prototypes when they encounter different names. Use a 5% significance level. Let the parameter of interest be the probability that a student would assign the name Tim to the face on the left.   We're being a bit tricky here...   , where is the concatenation operator.
